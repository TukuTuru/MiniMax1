/**
 * Template Name: Main Template
 * 
 * The main template file
 *
 * This is the most generic template file in a WordPress theme
 * and one of the two required files for a theme (the other being style.css).
 * It is used to display a page when nothing more specific matches a query.
 * E.g., it puts together the home page when no home.php file exists.
 *
 * In MiniMax1 this Template also holds a Template name, 
 * as otherwise Toolset Layouts will not recognize the call for its render function.
