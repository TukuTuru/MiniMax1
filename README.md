# MinimaX1

Updates coming soon (Automatic upgrade notification and new versions supporting Blocks, Bootstrap 4 and more)

## Description

It's suggested to use MinimaX-1 Theme either with Toolset Layouts or Toolste Views, but not Toolset Blocks or other Gutenberg oriented page builders.
This Theme represents the most minimalistic and most functional possible integration of Toolset Layouts and Views (best used with Layouts) into any WordPress Theme.

A blank slate is ready to be filled with Cells using Toolset Layouts, or HTML code using Content Templates of Views.

If you don't use Toolset, you can still see your Content and Titles (See "IMPORTANT" below).
In that case however please enqueue Bootstrap manually, as MinimaX-1 relies on Toolset delivering Bootstrap 3

## Usage

- You need Toolset to load Bootstrap 3.0 (not 4!!), this theme does not provide Bootstrap at all.
Toolset Provides it already, so we can spare the space...

- No WooCommerce Support inbuilt, see here how to add it: https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/Declaring-WooCommerce-support-in-themes.

- The Theme features a 404 file so you can style that in Layouts.

- No Menu, no Sidebar, nothing but blank slate. 

- Study the Code Comments, they are extensive for educational purpose.

- Please report issues to this Git Project

## Note

You can of course delete the CODE_OF_CONDUCT File from the theme when using it, it is not related to the Theme itself (and still the theme is small enough :P ). You are free to customize as you like.

This is an experimental product, please use at your own risk.
