# MinimaX1

## Description

MinimaX1 is the minimalistic version of a dynamic theme that integrates with Toolset (best used with Layouts)

When you install it you are presented with a blank slate.

The Theme is oriented on "Let Plugins provide functionality and the Theme design"

Just, this Theme as well leaves the design the to the Plugins, it just provides a blank slate to be designed with Toolset.

If you don't use Toolset, you can still see your Content and Titles (See "IMPORTANT" below)

If you use Toolset , you'll design the contents with either Layouts, Content Templates or native WordPresss editors.

Usually, you design from edge to edge of the screen, but with Content Templates that's more tricky than Layouts

The theme is not really suggested to be used without Toolset as it basically has no settings or whatsoever, however if you know how to customize a Theme in the code, it's possible of course.

## Usage

IMPORTANT: You need Toolset to load Bootstrap 3.0, this theme does not provide Bootstrap.
Toolset Provides it already, so we can spare the space...

The Theme features a 404 file so you can style that in Layouts

No Menu, no Sidebar, nothing but blank slate.

Study the Code Comments, they are extensive for educational purpose

Please report issues to this Git Project

This is an experimental product, please use at your own risk.

## Note

You can of course delete the CODE_OF_CONDUCT File from the theme when using it, it is not related to the Theme itself (and still the theme is small enough :P )
